For this part of the work and, in relation to the game, I have decided to base it on a casino aesthetic, since it is played with cards. That is why the interface is summarized in 3 parts: 

- Introduction: Where the name of the game is shown with an elegant title and where the player will enter his Name and his starting Money. Followed by a button to start the game.

- Intermediary: Where the name of the entered player and the corresponding money will be shown. Next, the player can enter the bet amount and next to it two buttons, New Round and End Game.

- Game: Where it will be subdivided into 2 parts; that of the player, where the cards will be shown, and these will be requested using the Request Card button below, or if you think it is convenient, press this button. And finally, once the round is over, the opponent's cards will be shown below.
