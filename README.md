For this part of the work and, in relation to the game, I have decided to base it on a casino aesthetic, since it is played with cards. That is why the interface is summarized in 3 parts: 

- Introduction: Where the name of the game is shown with an elegant title and where the player will enter his Name and his starting Money. Followed by a button to start the game.

- Intermediary: Where the name of the entered player and the corresponding money will be shown. Next, the player can enter the bet amount and next to it two buttons, New Round and End Game.

- Game: Where it will be subdivided into 2 parts; that of the player, where the cards will be shown, and these will be requested using the Request Card button below, or if you think it is convenient, press this button. And finally, once the round is over, the opponent's cards will be shown below.

And about the logic of the game, it is based on a deck of cards between 1 to 7 and the special one of 0.5. The player will enter his name and initial money and click start game, then he will have to enter the bet amount and click on a new round. This money must obviously be less than or equal to the initial money, otherwise an error will occur that will prevent you from continuing the game. He will begin by asking for one card, after another, until he thinks it is convenient to stand to see if he beats his opponent, the bet money will be added, or if he exceeds 7 1/2, in that case he would lose the bet. In case of a tie, you would not lose any money, but if both are below 7 1/2, the person closest to this will win. Afterwards, if the player wants to finish the game, they will only have to click on end the game and a message will appear thanking them for their game and showing them their final money.
